## About

This directory contains _simulated_ offsetting data. Its intention is to calculate the hypothetical impact of a national Springer Compact agreement for Germany (at the moment the Max Planck Society is the only German institution taking part in the programme).
To do this, our colleagues at the OA analytics group performed a bibliometrical analysis and created a raw data set with the following parameters:

- published with Springer Nature
- not a Gold OA journal
- publication year 2016 or 2017
- RP author at a German institution
